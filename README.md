# Smart-Tank-Visual-SLAM-Based-Competitive-Robot-with-Object-Detection-for-STEM-Education
This project proposes a project that combines the latest STEM knowledge from diverse  disciplines, including computer science, mathematics, and electronic engineering. The project  develops an intelligent tank by applying computer vision, SLAM, embedded systems, basic  electronics, and 3D printing. These exclusive illusion materials can support the teacher to master the  methodology quickly and teach the youth the principle by offering hands-on experience on  our proposed tank. It aims to provide a prior experience to the youth of STEM products that  may ignite their passion for STEM subjects, even devoting themselves to future STEM careers.
